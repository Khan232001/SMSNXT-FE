        <br />
        Analytics Information. <br />
        We may use Google Analytics or other service providers for analytics
        services. These analytics services may use cookies and other tracking
        technologies to help us analyze how users use the Service. Information
        generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other usage
        information) may be transmitted to and stored by Google Analytics and
        other service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these
        service providers may use this information for purposes such as
        evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the
        Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service
        activity and other Internet usage. You may exercise choices regarding
        the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to
        https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google
        Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. Additionally, we may use third-party
        Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.

        <br />
        Third-Party Ad Networks. <br />
        Certain companies may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance
        ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for
        Interest-based Ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to
        exercise certain choices regarding targeting. You can learn more about
        the DAA AdChoices Program at http://www.youradchoices.com/ and its
        opt-out program for mobile apps at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.{" "}
        <br />
        In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate
        in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). NAI has developed a tool
        that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered
        by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such
        targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even
        if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you
        will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Opting out of one or more NAI
        or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer
        under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will
        affect this and other services, but does not mean you will no longer
        receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
