          <p className="font-bold ">Description of Platform and Service.</p>
          smsNXT provides a web-based application (“smsNXT”) for managing mobile
          marketing campaigns including mobile messaging capabilities (the
          “Service”). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that
          augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to this
          Agreement. You understand and agree that the Service is provided to
          you on an “AS-IS” basis and that SimpleTexting assumes no
          responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure
          to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are
          responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access and
          subsequent usage may involve third party fees (such as Internet access
          to use the Service). <br /> <br />
          <p className="font-bold ">YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS.</p>
          In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you
          are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person
          barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States
          or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true,
          accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted
          by the Service’s registration form (such information being the
          “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the
          Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If
          you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
          incomplete, or SimpleTexting has reasonable grounds to suspect that
          such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
          SmsNXT has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
          any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion
          thereof). Children under the age of 13 may not sign up for an SmsNXT
          account or use any SmsNXT services.x

          <p className="font-bold ">PAYMENT AND FEES.</p>
          A. Payment by Credit Card / Paypal. You hereby authorize SmsNXT to

          SmsNXT at the rates set forth on smsNXT.com/pricing or agreed upon
          rate.
          <br /> <br />
          B. Pass Through Charges. If at any time after execution of this
          Agreement, a Network Operator or other Third-Party changes the
          Third-Party Charges on Provisioned Phone Numbers then SmsNXT , at its
          discretion, may pass through such fees (“Pass Through Charges”) to you
          at cost.

          </p>
          <p className="font-bold ">MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY.</p>
          You (the “MEMBER”) will receive a password and account designation
          upon completing the Service’s registration process. You are
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and
          account designation and are fully responsible for all activities that
          occur under your password or account designation. You agree to (a)
          immediately notify SmsNXT of any unauthorized use of your password or
          account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit
          from your account at the end of each session. SmsNXT cannot and will
          not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to

          sound, photographs, graphics, audio, video, messages or other
          materials (“Content”), whether publicly posted or privately
          transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such
          Content originated. This means that you, and not SmsNXT , are entirely
          responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or
          otherwise make available via the Service. SmsNXT does not control the
          Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the
          accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Under no circumstances
          will SmsNXT be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not
          limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any
          loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any
          Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via
          the Service
          <br /> <br />
          SmsNXT is solely a facilitator of the message traffic and has no
          visibility into or control over individual Messages as they are
          transmitted through SmsNXT and has no responsibility or liability with

          may use programmatic means to filter (pre-screen) your messages and
          block your campaigns or account due to message keywords that SmsNXT
          has determined, in it’s sole description, may violate an applicable,
          rule, regulation, or law.

          without limitation, Section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), the
          CAN-SPAM Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 7701-7713), the Telemarketing Consumer
          Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 6101-6108), the Federal
          Trade Commission Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 C.F.R. § 310 et seq.),
          the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C. §§ 227), the Federal
          Communications Commission regulations (47 C.F.R. 64.1200 et seq.) and
          orders implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, all federal
          and state Do Not Call and calling-time restriction laws and
          regulations, and, as applicable for SMS to Canadian numbers, the
          CRTC’s Unsolicited Telecommunications Rules, including the CRTC
          Telemarketing Rules, National DNCL Rules, and Automatic Dialing and
          Announcing Device Rules, Telecom Decision CRTC 2007-48, as amended.;

          without limitation, the CTIA Short Code Monitoring Handbook and

          Message Requirements”). SmsNXT provides the software and
          carrier-connectivity through which you send your messages; you are
          solely and exclusively responsible for complying with Applicable
          Message Requirements (and for defending and indemnifying SmsNXT from
          any claims in which it is alleged that you failed to do so). If for
          any reason SmsNXT suspects that your use of its Services in any way is
          contrary to any Applicable Message Requirements, it reserves the right
          to request a written explanation from you, the client, including the
          method of collecting the subscriber’s phone numbers and a guarantee
          signed by you that all the people on your subscriber list provided you
          prior express written consent to receive text messages from you of the
          type that you had sent. You agree to provide all such information and
          documents reasonably requested by SmsNXT . SmsNXT reserves the right
          to take any action it thinks appropriate in the case of
          non-compliance, including but not limited to suspension and/or
          cancellation of the account, without any liability to you therefor.
          <br /> <br />
          F. You represent and warrant that you are aware that, among other
          requirements, the TCPA requires prior express written consent from a
          consumer before you can send them marketing text messages using an
          autodialer, with no purchase required as a condition of their consent,
          and such consent must be clear and conspicuous. Furthermore, damages
          for each message sent in violation of the TCPA is $500 and can be
          $1500 if the violation is proven to be “willful and knowing.”
          <br /> <br />
          G. Through the Platform and Services, we provide notification and
          messaging services that allow paid subscribers to contact and send
          information to their user database through mobile text messaging
          services and other mobile communication systems. We have made efforts
          to make the Platform and Services are Systems and Organization
          Controls 2 (“SOC 2”) and Health Insurance Portability and
          Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) compliant but you are ultimately
          responsible for ensuring compliance with all laws, rules and
          regulations applicable to you and you organization. After purchasing a
          subscription to the Platform, you can communicate with your customers
          utilizing the dashboard. As part of the Services and Platform, we
          provide businesses and organizations with a variety of tools to input
          names, mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and other information
          that have been collected by Customer on an opt-in basis and to help
          you import such customer data (collectively, “Customer Data”).
          However, contact information should be imported only if your users
          have given you consent to receive a specified type of messaging from
          you (as required by applicable law or your privacy policy). Further,
          Provider does not initiate, send or generate any messages for you or
          on your behalf; rather, the messages are initiated by you using our
          Platform at your sole discretion, subject to these Terms. For example,
          Provider does not draft the content of your messages, control when the
          messages are sent or to whom, or provide or generate any phone numbers
          to be messaged through the Platform or Site. All of these functions
          must be manually performed by you and are not automated. We cannot and
          will not send any messages randomly or send recurring messages, and
          cannot generate random or sequential phone numbers for you. We will
          not provide you with any legal advice on how to comply with applicable
          law using the Platform, and nothing on the Site or the Platform should
          be taken as providing such advice. You will be solely responsible for
          complying with applicable law under these Terms.
          <br /> <br />
          You agree that you will include clear opt-out/unsubscribe information
          on your messages when required to do so by any applicable law or
          regulation and otherwise adhere to the Consumer Best Practices
          Guidelines promulgated by the Mobile Marketing Association, if
          applicable to your messages, and that you will promptly process all
          such do-not-text or do-not-call requests and maintain those numbers on
          your internal do-not-call/text list.
          <br /> <br />
          H. You shall schedule your messages responsibly and in a manner that
          is courteous to the recipients pursuant to local, state, national, and
          international calling time rules and regulations. You are solely
          responsible for obtaining any rights or licenses to any data,
          including without limitation sound files, pictures or videos for
          inclusion in any outbound messages. If you are unfamiliar or unclear
          on the legalities of any message that you intend to initiate through
          the Services, you must consult with your attorney prior to your use of
          the SmsNXT Sites or Services.
          <br /> <br />
          I. You represent and warrant that you have all power and authority and
          have procured all rights and licenses necessary to use and text enable
          those Phone Numbers utilized for SmsNXT services. In the case of
          shared use Phone Numbers, you expressly represent that you are the
          Phone Number Owner.
          <br /> <br />
          J. Provider maintains a no-tolerance policy toward spam. Although
          Provider does not assume the duty or obligation to monitor messages,
          we reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to monitor
          any and all messages created or sent by you or any third party at any
          time without prior notice to ensure that they conform to the
          guidelines and policies pertaining to our Site and Services. All
          mobile marketing messages must conform to the latest available
          best-practice guidelines drafted and published by the MMA (currently
          available at
          http://www.mmaglobal.com/policies/consumer-best-practices) and the
          CTIA (currently available at
          https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/190719-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf),
          which you agree to review and abide by before using the Platform. For
          example, and without limitation, these guidelines may recommend “STOP”
          instructions using SMS/MMS Codes (see Provision and Use of SMS/MMS
          Codes for more information) in order to allow recipients to “opt-out”
          of receiving future messages. In this regard, the Platform provides
          mandatory STOP instructions on your first welcome message and
          pre-populates STOP instructions for subsequent messages. However, you
          are solely responsible for any claims or incidents that may result
          from your removal of these STOP instructions. If a user replies to a
          text message you send through the Platform with messages other than
          STOP instructions, they will appear in your inbox. You are solely
          responsible for monitoring messages received in your inbox. You agree
          that any individuals requesting “Do-Not-Call” (“DNC”) status shall
          immediately be placed on your company DNC list and, except as
          otherwise noted above, Provider shall have no other responsibility for
          notifying you of such opt-outs. You further agree that you will not
          initiate any subsequent messages to any individuals after they make a
          DNC or other opt-out or STOP request.
          <br /> <br />
          You hereby acknowledge and confirm that you are solely responsible for
          the content of your messaging. You will ensure that any and all
          consents have been obtained, including, without limitation, consent
          for the delivery of commercial and marketing messages. You hereby
          acknowledge that Provider merely provides a platform for facilitating
          the sending of your text messages, and that you shall have sole
          responsibility and liability for your messages and communications. You
          also agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Provider from and
          against any claims or damages which may result from your use of the
          Platform and Services, including, but not limited to, claims, damages,
          or lawsuits threatened or filed by third parties as well as inquiries
          and investigations by local, state and federal regulators (see
          Indemnity provision for a complete list of your indemnities to
          Provider). We reserve the right to hold, suspend or terminate your
          account or access to the Platform and/or Services as well as your use
          of the Site or SMS/MMS Codes for any alleged violation.
          <br /> <br />
          K. The Platform may NOT be used for sending any unsolicited messages
          except with our prior written approval and may NOT be used for sending
          any messages that violate applicable law or these Terms. You agree to
          our Privacy Policy and anti-spam policies described in these Terms and
          agree to enforce the indicated permission-based marketing practices
          with anyone using your account as required by law. You agree to assume
          full responsibility and accept the legal consequences of any action by
          anyone using your account and will indemnify us in relation to the
          same, according to these Terms. We reserve the right to suspend or
          terminate your account at any time, at our sole discretion, and
          without prior warning or refund if your account activity is reasonably
          believed to violate any term in these Terms or applicable law.
          Violation of applicable anti-spam laws and regulations, regardless of
          whether specifically described below, may also result in third-party
          legal actions against you. Provider also reserves the right to
          terminate your access to the Platform and Services at any time and
          immediately if we believe that your conduct is harmful to the
          interests of Provider or the “Provider Parties” as defined below. We
          reserve the sole discretion and right to permanently delete any
          Customer Data stored in your account immediately after your account
          termination and any of your assigned SMS/MMS Codes may be reassigned
          by us to other users.
          <br /> <br />
          L. Terms Applicable to the Purchase of Subscriptions to the Platform
          and Services.
          <br /> <br />
          A. Generally. To purchase access and use of the Platform and gain
          access to our Services, you must be at least eighteen (18) years of
          age or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction of
          residence and authorized to bind the specific entity on whose behalf
          you are accessing and using the Platform or obtaining Services (if
          applicable). Prior to the purchase of access to the Platform or our
          provision of the Services, unless we make alternative payment
          arrangement with you, you must provide us with a valid credit card
          number and associated payment information including all of the
          following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) your credit
          card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration,
          and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card. By
          submitting that information to us or our third party credit card
          processor, you agree that you authorize us and/or our processor to
          charge your card at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of
          credit card authorization. For the specific subscription to the
          Platform/Services which you order, you agree to pay the price
          applicable (including any sales taxes and surcharges) as of the time
          you submit the order. Provider or our third party credit card/payment
          processor will automatically bill your credit card or other form of
          payment submitted as part of the order process for such price. Please
          be aware that the current text/SMS standard permits only 160
          characters in an individual message (e.g., standard text and
          hyperlinks). The submission of a seemingly-valid text/SMS message or
          broadcast will cause an associated quantity of messages to be debited
          from your account. Accordingly, the submission of a seemingly-valid
          text/SMS message or broadcast exceeding 160 characters will yield
          distinct, individually debited messages, each of 160 characters or
          less, together comprising the original message. Please be aware that
          the current MMS standard permits only 1600 characters in an individual
          message or certain types and limited sizes of multimedia messages
          (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF files). The submission of a
          seemingly-valid MMS message or broadcast will cause an associated
          quantity of messages to be debited from your account. Accordingly, the
          submission of a seemingly-valid MMS message or broadcast exceeding
          1600 characters will yield distinct, individually debited messages,
          each of 1600 characters or less, together comprising the original
          message. You can obtain the status of your account at any time through
          the online interface. Delivery and deliverability rates, which are the
          responsibility of third party carriers and not Provider, for any
          text/SMS/MMS messages sent using the Platform and Site may vary.
          <br /> <br />
          <p className="font-bold ">DOWNTIME & REFUND POLICY</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          A. For purposes of this Agreement, a Unit of Downtime is one period of
          at least 1 day during which access to www.smsnxt.com is unavailable
          because of problems with hardware or system software. Downtime does
          not include:
          <br />
          <br />
          problems caused by factors outside of our reasonable control
          <br />
          <br />
          problems resulting from any actions or inactions by you or any third
          party
          <br />
          <br />
          problems resulting from your equipment and/or third party equipment
          not within our sole control, or
          <br />
          <br />
          network unavailability during scheduled maintenance of our network
          and/or web servers.
          <br />
          <br />
          B. In any calendar month, we guarantee that Downtime will not exceed 1
          Unit of Downtime excluding, however, regularly scheduled maintenance.
          Any regularly scheduled maintenance will be performed during the hours
          of 6pm and 8am. We work to ensure the functioning of all web servers
          through continuous monitoring by our staff.
          <br />
          <br />
          C. If Downtime exceeds 1 Units of Downtime in any calendar month, we
          will, upon your written request, credit your account (a “Downtime
          Credit”) in an amount equal to the pro-rata price for one (1) day of
          service, for each instance of Downtime as that term is defined herein.
          <br />
          <br />
          D. To receive Downtime Credit, you must request such credit by sending
          an email to support@smsnxt.com within seven (7) days after the
          occurrence of Downtime. The aggregate maximum number of Downtime
          Credits to be issued for any and all instances of Downtime occurring
          in a single calendar month will not exceed seven (7). Downtime Credits
          will be applied upon issue of the first invoice following the request
          for Downtime Credit, unless the Downtime occurs in your final month of
          service. In such case, a refund for the dollar value of the Downtime
          Credit will be mailed to you within thirty (30) days of the expiration
          of your service agreement.
          <br /> <br />
          E. If you are unhappy with any aspect of our service, please contact
          us and we will attempt to rectify the situation. Because we are
          providing a service, which starts when you create the account, we can
          not provide a refund except when the service has not been acceptable.
          This is at our discretion only. No refunds will be made if we
          terminate your account due to violation of our Acceptable Use Policy
          or any other violation of our Terms and Conditions, except as may be
          provided therein. This does not affect your statutory rights. No bill
          credit will be given for a period of suspension.
          <br /> <br />

          obligations, (a) SmsNXT will provide you prompt notice of any such
          Indemnifiable Claim, provided, however, that the failure to give such
          prompt notice shall not relieve you of your obligations hereunder
          except to the extent that you were actually and materially prejudiced
          by such failure; (b) you will have the sole and exclusive authority to
          defend or settle any such Claim (provided that you will obtain our
          consent in connection with any act or forbearance required by SmsNXT ,
          which consent will not be unreasonably withheld); and (c) SmsNXT will
          reasonably cooperate with you in connection with your activities
          hereunder, at your expense. SmsNXT reserves the right, at its own
          expense, to participate in the defense of a Claim. Notwithstanding
          anything herein to the contrary, you will not settle any Claims for
          which you have an obligation to indemnify pursuant to this Section
          admitting liability or fault on behalf SmsNXT , nor create any
          obligation on behalf of SmsNXT without its prior written consent.
